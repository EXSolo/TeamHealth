# TeamHealth

This Bukkit plugin is an extention to [ghowden's UHC Plugin](https://github.com/Eluinhost/ultrahardcore).
This short tutorial will show you how to use it:  
* Put both plugins in your plugins folder and start the server.
* You can access the feature by typing `/feature on/off/toggle TeamHealth`.
  By doing this the `PlayerList feature` will be disabled if it was enabled before
* If either the `PlayerList` or `TeamHealth` feature get enabled, the other one will be disabled
* If the feature is acting weird after a reload just disable and enable it again
